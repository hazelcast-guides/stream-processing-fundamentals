:description: Use the Hazelcast Pipeline API to build an application for modifying machine shop operations based on real time telemetry. 

{description}

== Context

ACME operates thousands of machines, each reporting many datapoints each second. Measurements include things like bit temperature and RPM. Breakage is expensive, both in replacement parts and in downtime. Maintenance schedules can prevent some loss, but we want to go beyond that to monitor operations in real time. If excessive bit temperatures are caught in time, breakage can be averted by immediately reducing the cutting speed.

In this lab, we will implement a pipeline which processes telemetry events from a Kafka topic.  The pipeline will parse the events and, for each machine, compute a 10s tumbling average of the bit temperature.  From there the pipeline will fork.  One fork will record the current 10s average to another IMap which will be used for monitoring.  In this lab, a python client uses a listener to watch the IMap containing the 10s averages and displays them in real time.  The other fork of the pipeline looks up machine specific looks up machine specific limits in the "machine_profiles" map and applies a "green"/"orange"/"red" label to each 10s average.  Finally, the pipeline performs de-duplication so that only changes
to the "green"/"orange"/"red" status remain and, finally, each status change is published to a topic there the machine emulator will pick it up and adjust the cutting speed accordingly.

A schematic is shown below.

== Before You Begin
You will need the following installed on your system:

* JDK 21 or later
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.8 or later]
* Your preferred Java IDE (We recommend https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=AMER_en_US-PST+MST_IDEA_Branded&term=intellij+idea&content=602143185985&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAr8eqBhD3ARIsAIe-buM14qxoPph8ClqF1e4IL-xsv9LLe9w35ts2Q7Pt1uoS6vqc-8K-Cm0aAv1oEALw_wcB&section=mac[IntelliJ IDEA])
* https://docs.hazelcast.com/clc/latest/install-clc[Hazelcast Command Line Client]
* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]

== Step 1: Validate the Lab Environment
. Download the repo from https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/stream-processing-fundamentals/

.  Run the following commands to start your lab environment.
+
```shell
mvn install
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```
+
You should see  7 services up and running.  You may also see an eighth service called `refdata_loader` which exits after it has loaded data into the `machine_profiles` map.
+
Each service is described briefly below.
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| *Service*
| *Description*  

| hz1
| A Hazelcast node, 1 of 2.  This node has a port mapping so that you can connect to it using CLC at localhost:5701.

| hz2
| A Hazelcast node, 2 of 2. Will form a cluster with hz1

| mc              
| The Hazelcast Management Center. Accessible at http://localhost:8080.   

| event_generator 
| Emulates traffic from a set of machines. Writes to `machine_events`. Listens to `machine_controls`. 

| ui
| A Python program that listens to the `machine_events` map and displays temperature data graphically. Accessible at http://localhost:8050

| redpanda
| A Kafka-compatible message broker.

| kafka-ui
| A UI that can be used for viewing events in the Kafka topics used byt his lab.   It is accessible at http://localhost:8000
|===

== Step 2: Get to Know the Data

. Access the Kafka UI at http://localhost:8000 and observe the events in the "machine_events" topic.
+
image:events.png[events]

. Open up the management center (http://localhost:8080) and select "SQL" from the menu on the left.
+
image:MC_SQL.png[MC]

. Run `select * from machine_profiles` in the Data Explorer.
+
You will see that for each machine there is a serial number, information about the location and the warning and critical temperature limits for that particular machine.
+
image:profiles.png[profiles]

. In a terminal window, set up the Command Line Client to connect to the Hazelcast instance in Docker. Note that, in the command below, "Docker" is just a nickname for your cluster.  The configuration will be stored on your local machine, and you will be able to run commands on the cluster by passing `-c Docker`.
+
```shell
clc config add Docker cluster.name=dev cluster.address=localhost:5701
```

. Validate your CLC configuration by running the same query as above via the CLC.
+
```
clc -c Docker sql -q "select * from machine_profiles"
```

[NOTE]
From this point forward, you can use either Management Center or CLC to run SQL queries and monitor jobs.

== Step 3: Learn About Data Formats

=== GenericRecord

It is a best practice to avoid using POJOs in Pipelines if that POJO will be stored in a Hazelcast map.  It can cause 
class loading problems.  

[NOTE] 
When using _Compact_ or _Portable_ serialization, if a POJO is accessed in server-side 
code, it will be be deserialized as a _GenericRecord_ if the POJO class is not 
on the server's class path. Accordingly, server side code must be written to handle either
a _GenericRecord_ or a POJO depending on whether the POJO class is present.

In this lab, you will be working with _MachineProfile_ objects and _MachineStatusSummary_, both of which are defined in `common/src/main/java`.  However, those classes are not deployed with your job, so you will need to access them using GenericRecord.  An example of GenericRecord usage is shown below.

```java
GenericRecord machineProfile;
short bitTemperature = machineProfile.getInt16("warningTemp");
```
For more information on GenericRecord and accessing domain objects without domain classes see
https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/clusters/accessing-domain-objects.

[NOTE]
It is OK to use the `MachineStatusEvent` class directly on the server side because, unlike the 2 classes mentioned above, it is never written into an IMap

=== Tuples

As data proceeds through your pipeline its shape changes.  For example, you may look up the warning 
and critical temperatures for a particular machine and send them along with the original event to the next stage
in the pipeline.  There is no need to create special container classes for situations like this, you can use Tuples 
instead.  Here is an example.

```java
// create a 3-tuple that consists of the serial number and bit temperature from the event 
// and the warning temperature from the machine profile

GenericRecord p;
MachineStatusEvent e;

Tuple3<String,Short,Short> newEvent = 
        Tuple3.tuple3(e.getSerialNum(), e.getBitTemp(), p.getShort("warningTemp"));

// now, if we want to access fields from the 3-tuple, we use f0(), f1() and f2()
short bitTemp = newEvent.f1();
```

== Step 4: Deploy Your First Job

. In your IDE, navigate to the *monitoring-pipeline* project.  Open up  the *hazelcast.platform.labs.machineshop.TemperatureMonitorPipeline* class and review the code there.  
+
The main method, shown below, is boilerplate that helps with deploying the job to a cluster. You do not need to change this.
+
```java
    public static void main(String []args){
        Pipeline pipeline = createPipeline();
        pipeline.setPreserveOrder(true);

        JobConfig jobConfig = new JobConfig();
        jobConfig.setName("Temperature Monitor");
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance();
        hz.getJet().newJob(pipeline, jobConfig);
    }
```
+
You will do all of your work in the `createPipeline` method of this job. It always starts with creating a `Pipeline` object.  You then build up the Pipeline by adding stages to it.
+
```java
   public static Pipeline createPipeline(){
        Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create();
        // add your stages here
        return pipeline;
   }
```
+
[NOTE] 

We use the Shade plugin to bundle all project dependencies, other than Hazelcast, into a single jar. The Hazelcast classes should not be included because they are already on the server. Code with `com.hazelcast` package names cannot be deployed to a Hazelcast Cloud cluster.
+
Currently, the `createPipeline` method contains only a source (reading from the `machine_events` map) and a sink, which simply logs the events to the console.  This can be useful during debugging. In the next step, you'll make a small change to the Pipeline and walk through a typical code/test cycle.

. Make a small change to the output format in the *writeTo* statement just so we can walk through building and deploying a pipeline.  After you've made the change, you can deploy the pipeline using the commands below.
+
```shell
cd monitoring-pipeline
mvn package
cd ..
# use the submission script, passing the name of the cluster you want to run the job
./clc-scripts/submitjob.sh Docker
# look for the logging statements in the Hazelcast logs
docker compose logs --follow hz
Ctrl-C
```
+
You should see something like this in the Hazelcast cluster member log:
```shell
stream-processing-fundamentals-hz-1  | 2023-02-01 21:11:44,357 [ INFO] [hz.hungry_lehmann.jet.blocking.thread-0] [c.h.j.i.c.WriteLoggerP]: [172.19.0.5]:5701 [dev] [5.2.1] [temp_monitor_161114/loggerSink#0] New Event SN=HYV569
stream-processing-fundamentals-hz-1  | 2023-02-01 21:11:44,370 [ INFO] [hz.hungry_lehmann.jet.blocking.thread-0] [c.h.j.i.c.WriteLoggerP]: [172.19.0.5]:5701 [dev] [5.2.1] [temp_monitor_161114/loggerSink#0] New Event SN=FXQ058
stream-processing-fundamentals-hz-1  | 2023-02-01 21:11:44,591 [ INFO] [hz.hungry_lehmann.jet.blocking.thread-0] [c.h.j.i.c.WriteLoggerP]: [172.19.0.5]:5701 [dev] [5.2.1] [temp_monitor_161114/loggerSink#0] New Event SN=RUO239
stream-processing-fundamentals-hz-1  | 2023-02-01 21:11:44,640 [ INFO] [hz.hungry_lehmann.jet.blocking.thread-0] [c.h.j.i.c.WriteLoggerP]: [172.19.0.5]:5701 [dev] [5.2.1] [temp_monitor_161114/loggerSink#0] New Event SN=DYQ714
```

. Inspect the running job using Management Center or CLC

. Cancel the job. The Hazelcast cluster will remain up and events will continue to flow. 
```shell
./clc-scripts/canceljob.sh Docker
```
+
image:firstjob.png[first job]

. Pat yourself on the back! You've deployed your first pipeline.

== Step 5: Finish the Pipeline

Continue building the pipeline following the instructions in `TemperatureMonitorPipeline.java`
You may want to deploy and cancel the job multiple times while you are building the pipeline. When you are done, look at the UI.  You should be able to tell that your job is now controlling the machines.

image:jobdone.png[job done]

You can also see machine control events in the `event_generator` log.

```shell
docker compose logs --follow event_generator
```

NOTE: If at any point you get stuck, you can refer to the solution which you will find in the
*hazelcast.platform.labs.machineshop.solutions* package.

== Step 6: Deploy to Hazelcast Cloud

In this step, you will deploy your temperature monitoring Pipeline to a Hazelcast Cloud cluster. You will also connect the cloud cluster to the UI, refdata loader and event_generator.

. If you haven't already done so, navigate to https://cloud.hazelcast.com, create an account, and create a new "Production" cluster.  This will deploy a 3 node cluster.  

. After the cluster is deployed, go to the CLI section of the "Quick Connection Guide" as shown below. Follow steps 2  and 3 to set up CLC for your cloud cluster. 
+
image:viridian-clc-config.png[viridian-clc-config]

. The previous step should have given output similar to the following:
+
```
rmay@HZLCST-MBP-42 stream-processing-fundamentals % clc -c pr-tgouvd9r
Hazelcast CLC v5.3.5 (c) 2023 Hazelcast Inc.

* Participate in our survey at: https://forms.gle/rPFywdQjvib1QCe49
* Type 'help' for help information. Prefix non-SQL commands with \

Configuration : /Users/me/.hazelcast/configs/pr-tgouvd9r/config.yaml
Log      INFO : /Users/me/.hazelcast/logs/2023-11-27.log
```
We will need to tell Docker where to find the configuration files for your cluster.  In the above output, the configuration files for this cluster are  in the `$HOME/.hazelcast/configs/pr-tgouvd9r` directory.
+
In the shell or Windows command line where you will run your Docker commands, set the `VIRIDIAN_SECRETS_DIR` environment variable to the configuration directory.  See below for an example.  Be sure to use your Viridian cluster name.
+
```
export VIRIDIAN_SECRETS_DIR=$HOME/.hazelcast/configs/pr-tgouvd9r
```
+
. Start the refdata_loader, event_generator and ui using the viridian.compose setup. This pulls the environment variables you just set and allows the local Docker instances to talk to your Viridian cluster. 
+
```shell
docker compose -f viridian.compose.yaml up -d
```

. View the logs.
+
```shell
docker compose -f viridian.compose.yaml logs --follow
```

. Use Management Center via the Viridian console to verify that your cluster is receiving traffic.  

. Submit your job using the same script as before.  This time you will need to pass in the name of your cluster.  Use `clc config list` to see a list of known clusters.  An example is shown below.
+
```shell
clc-scripts % clc config list
 Configuration Name
 Docker
 dea-test
 pr-tgouvd9r  << Suppose you want to use this one

./clc-scripts/sumbit-job.sh pr-tgouvd9r
```
. Verify that the job is running using Management Center via the Viridian console. Look under _Stream Processing > Jobs_.

. We'll use CLC to view the logs from the Viridian cluster. First, you'll need to set up the API key and secret strings. In the Viridian console, go to _Account > Developer_ and set the API key. Do not navigate away from this screen.

. In your terminal window, open the CLC command line, specifying the name of your cluster. An example of the command is below.
+
```shell
clc -c pr-tgouvd9r
```

. At the CLC prompt, log in to your cluster. Enter the API key and secret when prompted.
+
```shell
\viridian login
```

. At the CLC prompt, view the logs for your cluster. You will need to specify the name of your cluster. An example is shown below. The output will be similar to the output you saw at the end of Step 4 above.
+
```shell
\viridian stream-logs EdSrvs
```
